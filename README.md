MTech DSE Batch 8 2024: Hand Sign recognition

Interaction with Deaf & mute people communicate with others using the sign language. Lack of
knowledge in sign language has resulted in the communication gap. Getting proficiency in the sign
language is difficult task unless its dedicated effort. Another challenge is there are lot of localized
sign language used by the people based upon the region where they live.

The Advancement of AI technology can bridge the communication gap which can lead to higher
social interaction. In real time sign-language can be detected and can be used for social
communication.

The scope of this project is to design and implement the basic sign language detection using images
first and then enhance the project to include real time detection. The future scope of the update of
this project to enhance the communication through advancement in technology will also be
determined.
The plan is to use python programming , Open CV , Deep learning technique like Convolution
neural network (CNN) model , SSD Mobilenet  to cater the real time detection for deaf and nonverbal
people.
The challenge would be training the model with the dataset of the sign language and preventing the
over-fitting of the training data.
